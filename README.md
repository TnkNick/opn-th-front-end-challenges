# Opn Front-end Code Challenges

This repository houses the front-end code challenges for Opn. These are small hands-on projects that are very relevant to the tasks you will be working on here.

## Ground Rules

* We prefer well-thought-out solutions over the quick-and-dirty kind. So take
  your time, if you need it.
* Average completion time so far has been around one to two weeks.
* For a take-home assignment, Please submit your project repo via email to your contact person.

## What to expect

We do understand that our code challenges are time intensive and not always easy to execute. We do recognize and value the time and effort applicants put into their submission. Our Code Challenges reflect some of the tasks and skills you'd need while working with us. We believe that these challenges will give you a deeper understanding of our product, what you'd be working on in the future and what level of commitment we look for in applicants.

## What we look for

Rather than a complex solution, which added a million features and is written in
10,000 lines of code, we look for:

* **Clarity:** You can write clear code that any devs could read and understand
  in one go.
* **Simplicity:** You can write gimmick-free and straightforward code with no
  ambiguities.
* **Defensiveness:** You can cover edge cases and treat user inputs with care.

## What happens after your submission

Our Engineers will review the code. Due to the number of submissions we receive, and time-intensive review process, it might take us **1 week** to give you feedback on the submission. Based on the feedback, we will invite you for a meeting to present more about your submission (a take-home assignment) and continue a technical interview.

## Challenges

You have 2 choices:

1. Take-home assignment replicate how software development actually happens. You can uses tools of your choosing, you get to do so in an environment you’re comfortable in and you get to do it on the schedule that works for them.

* **React & Vue** - [take-home assignment](https://github.com/opn-ooo/opn-th-front-end-challenges/tree/master/take-home)

2. Live-coding session is a real-time face-to-face engagement with interviewers during which you may demonstrate your coding abilities using your preferred code editor. We have an incomplete project that we will let you finish on time (around 2 hours).

### Have fun and we look forward to your submission
